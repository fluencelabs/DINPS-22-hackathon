# DINPS'22 hackathon challenge

Challenge for the DINPS 22 hackathon participants
[Fluence](https://fluence.network/) is supporting a [DINPS'22](https://research.protocol.ai/sites/dinps/programme/) hackathon in July 2022 organized by Protocol Labs academic department. Join the [discord](https://discord.gg/aFHQXnRT) to participate.

## Prize
2 best projects using Fluence & Aqua
$1000 x 2 best projects 

## Challenge track
Best use of Fluence and Aqua in your project or DApp. For more details and resources.

## General examples what you can build with Fluence & Aqua
* decentralize centralized components, bottlenecks and choke-points in your existing web3 DApp
* create decentralized peer-to-peer protocols to replace centralized off-chain solutions by means of decentralized off-chain oracles or by swapping centralized service providers, e.g., AWS Lambda, for a decentralized infrastructure
* decentralize centralized off-chain solutions such as relayers for single- or multi-chain bridges
* enable dynamic NFTs by creating one or more decentralized off-chain oracles to provide (continuous) data feeds to your NFTs


### Build use of Fluence off-chain compute

* Move complex computations for your project to off-chain Fluence network
* Plug DAO proposals to trigger off-chain computations
* Build a data processing engine for IPFS/Filecoin
* Any ideas of yours!

### Build a P2P protocol using Fluence 
* Decentralized cross-chain bridge relay for any EVM-based blockchain
* Decentralized access to any decentralized network node RPC
* Decentralized oracle for any blockchain
* Decentralized off-chain governance protocol
* Any other protocol built with Aqua that uses several nodes/services across the network


## About Fluence

Fluence provides the protocol, infrastructure and tools to enable decentralized compute for applications and backends on peer-to-peer networks. Nodes in the Fluence peer-to-peer network host discoverable services comprised of WebAssembly Interface Types (IT) modules. Resource discovery, e.g., FaaS, is achieved by function addressability rather than REST or JSON-RPC. Aqua, Fluence's purpose-built distributed systems programming language, allows developers to seamlessly program distributed networks and compose hosted services into decentralized applications. As a result, the Fluence protocol and solution stack allows you to quickly and effectively create and implement Web3 protocols and associated governance models within the decentralized serverless paradigm.
